# ssd-trim-enablement
Script to enable TRIM on an SSD

This script can be run on Raspberry Pi OS with an SSD connected via the [Homerun Adapter 1](https://homerun.network/products/adapter-1.html) device. 

It would be nice to make this more generic to work on a variety of devices. Wouldn't want to make it too complex to use though.
